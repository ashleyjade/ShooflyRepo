        <dt>Silk</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Silk is such a sweet girl. She's gentle enough for riders who are a
                little nervous about riding for the first time, but she's also very capable of doing more
                advanced things. Silk does a little bit of everything! She loves to trail ride, game,
                and play with her best friend and owner, Lani. She's insulin resistant, so she can't have
                too much sugar. That means if you want to give her a treat, you should come ask one of the horse
                girls if it's okay first. Silk is a 17 year old Quarter Horse registered under the name of
                Silk Town Anne and is 15 hands high.</dd>

        <dt>Jose</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Before Jose came to live on the farm, some of his favorite things
                included gaming, drill team, and long walks or runs at the beach. Jose absolutely loves
                people! He's almost always game for a little bit of cuddling. He also has a fun trick he likes
                to show campers. Ask any of the horse girls to see his 'zipper' trick. Jose is an 18
                year old Quarter Horse and 14.3 hands high.</dd>

        <dt>Stella</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Stella is our beautiful Appaloosa/Thoroughbred cross. Many kids think it looks like she has powdered
            sugar dusted over her back. She is 11 years old and 15 hands high, and is quite new to camp. Stella is
            really good at her job, and has the sweetest personality. She loves encouragement and being pet. She can
            go pretty fast, but takes care of her little riders. Outside of camp, she's an extremely good jumper,
            and loves to play with her owner Lani.

        <dt>Gypsy</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Gypsy is a tried-and-true steady girl. She's 18 years old, and 14.3 hands high. Her favorite thing in
             the world is napping. Gypsy has a pretty fun slow trot, perfect for riders who have never trotted
             before. Gypsy has really cool eyes- one of them is blue and the other is half blue and half brown! Gypsy
              is a Tobiano Pinto Quarter Horse.

        <dt>Miss Kitty</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Miss Kitty is built like a tank! She's a stout but fit lady who loves to walk and walk and walk. She
            has a nice, slow trot as well. Her back is wide and flat, so beginners feel stable. Miss Kitty is 13
            years old and 15 hands high.</dd>

        <dt>Thunder</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Do you remember Thunder? Thunder has been a favorite at Shoofly for
                many years. He is back this year, teaching another set of little kids to love ponies. Thunder
                is a great pony to learn riding on because he is so gentle and kind. Back in his youth, Thunder
                used to be a fancy hunter/jumper pony, but now he enjoys getting brushed, braided, tacked up and
                ridden by Shoofly campers. Thunder is about 36 years old and is only 12.3 hands high. He is a
                Welsh/Arab cross, and because he is so small he can only carry kids that are less than
                50lbs.</dd>

        <dt>Confetti</dt>
        <div class="horse">
            <dd>Confetti is our youngest and most unique horse on the farm. She was  adopted April 2013 by Lani from
            the BLM. Confetti is a mustang and she was captured from the Paisley Desert in central Oregon. Lani trained
            and gentled Confetti last summer and took her all the way to Fort Worth,
            Texas to compete in the Mustang Million competition. Now Confetti lives it up at Shoofly playing with
            kids. She is 2 years old and still growing.</dd>
